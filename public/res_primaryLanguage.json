      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ As a 20-year-old emerging artist named Albiery, I navigate the vibrant streets of New York City with a brush in hand and a mind filled with colors and contrasts. My journey into the world of art is relatively fresh, spanning just a year, yet within this brief period, I've found solace, expression, and a profound connection to my innermost struggles and triumphs.\n Primarily working with acrylics, I dance between the worlds of traditional canvas painting and the dynamic realm of spray paint, exploring the intersection of urban art and personal narrative. With each stroke, I unveil a playful yet poignant aesthetic, characterized by vibrant hues and whimsical cartoon-like figures. These pieces serve as windows into my psyche, offering glimpses of my journey through the kaleidoscope of emotions. Yet, beneath the surface lies a deeper narrative, one that reflects the duality of my existence. As a person grappling with bipolar disorder and ADHD, my art becomes a vessel for navigating the tumultuous currents of mood swings and mental turbulence. Through the juxtaposition of bold reds and calming blues, I symbolize the erratic fluctuations and delicate balance of my inner world, inviting viewers to contemplate the complexities of mental health.\n Born and raised in the heart of Queens, New York, I am a product of the city's raw energy and resilient spirit. Growing up amidst the challenges of a rough neighborhood, I discovered art as both a sanctuary and a weaponâ€”a means to transcend adversity and reclaim my narrative. It was only as my struggles with bipolar disorder intensified that I fully embraced art as my chosen path, recognizing its power to articulate what words cannot. Outside of my studio practice, I navigate the art world in a different capacity, serving as an art handler within New York City's bustling museum scene. Through transportation, installations, and meticulous packing, I immerse myself in the creative process, forging connections with masterpieces while honing my craft.\n Ultimately, my art is a testament to resilience, a visual symphony of triumph over adversity. It is a reflection of my journey as a Dominican artist from Queens, navigating the complexities of mental health and urban life with grace and creativity. With every brushstroke, I invite you to join me on this colorful odyssey, where pain and beauty coexist, and every canvas tells a story of hope and redemption.",
